AlarMe client

This is my Bachelor's degree project. 
AlarMe is an app, that allows car drivers and bike riders to be alarmed, when an emergency vehicle is coming nearby. 
AlarMe Client is an Android app. It works with Alarme-Server application. 
To implement this, you need to insert google-services.json file into app folderyou can get from Firebase to allow the app to connect to Firebase DB.
